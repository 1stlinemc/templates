Hi there! Welcome to the LogicBlox IDE!

To get you started, we have created a small example schema
and some data. From here, you can follow these steps to get started:

1) Open schema.logic

2) Press the "Add Block" button to add the schema

3) Open data.logic

4) Press the "Exec" button to execute the delta rules here

5) Go to the immediate window, and type 'print week_sales'

From here, play around some more, or create your own LogicBlox space as
you see fit! :) It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
